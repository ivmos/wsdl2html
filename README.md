This project is a fork of https://github.com/chenjianjx/wsdl2html
(started after close PR: https://github.com/chenjianjx/wsdl2html/pull/9)

This fork might be useful for you if you use JAX-WS as it autoincludes descriptions in generated html based on your javadoc classes. If you include the comments directly in the WSDL this approach is not useful for you.

Besides it has some minor changes:
* Methods are ordered alphabetically so that order does not change each time you use wsdl2html.
* Template style changes using width better.
* Removed "require" field as it's not autogenerated. I don't want to change the html manually at all, everything needs to be in the code.

# wsdl2html

Converts WSDLs to html documents which are readable by everybody. 

Online version: [http://www.wsdl2html.com](http://www.wsdl2html.com)
